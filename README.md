# 🖋️ File Read & Write Challenge + 🧪 Error Handling Lab

This repository contains a Python script that reads content from a user-specified file, modifies it, and writes the modified content to a new file. It includes robust error handling for file-related issues.

## 📌 Features

- ✅ Reads content from a file
- 🔁 Modifies the file content (converts to uppercase)
- 💾 Writes the result to a new file
- ⚠️ Handles common file I/O errors gracefully

## 💡 How It Works

1. User is prompted to enter a filename.
2. The program reads the file (if it exists).
3. It modifies the content using a function (`modify_content()`).
4. It saves the modified content to a new file prefixed with `modified_`.

## 🧪 Example

**Input File (example.txt):**
